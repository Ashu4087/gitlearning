API ->  Application prigramming Interface ..
-- It is basically a messanger which takes the request from the user and tells the system what is needed and 
takes the info from system and return the response.

Q> why do we need API ..can't the user directly ask for the info/data needed..?
--> For the security purpose as well the more number of user, system use api to interact with users and may have api key 
to veryfiy the users and provides the data for which they are authenticated..

Q> what is the types of data send by the api?
--> The data is Basically in XLM/JSON format..

JSON (JavaScript Object notation) basically stores data in object form and redirect/transfer data to the requested user ...
it may be browser...


HTTP request method : 
    Both GET and POST method is used to transfer data from client to server in HTTP protocol but
     Main difference between POST and GET method is that
    GET carries request parameter appended in URL string while POST carries request parameter in message body .
    Get is use to fetch documents while Post is used for updating data..
    Get has limited max length of url but is not for post
    Get can be cache but not post.

Network Request:

fetch:-
JavaScript can send network requests to the server and load new information whenever itâ€™s needed.
    And all of that without reloading the page!
