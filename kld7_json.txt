JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data
JSON is "self-describing" and Human readable easy to understand
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
JSON is language independent *

Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.

'''When sending data to a web server, the data has to be a string'''.
Convert a 'JavaScript object' into a string with JSON.stringify().

JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:
JSON.stringify()

eg: 
let jsObj = {
    name : "ask" , 
    age : 23 , 
    location : "India" ,
    isHuman : yes // boolean
};

let jsonString = JSON.stringify(jsObj);

#Need of parsing..
JSON is use to exchange data to/from a web server.
'''When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string '''.
Parse the data with JSON.parse(), and the data becomes a JavaScript object.
""Make sure the text is in 'JSON format', or else you will get a syntax error.""

When using the JSON.parse() on a JSON derived from an array, the method will return a JavaScript array,
instead of a JavaScript object. 



JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:
JSON.parse()

let newjsonOjb = JSON.parse(jsonString);

You can receive pure text from a server and use it as a JavaScript object.
You can send a JavaScript object to a server in pure text format.
You can work with data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.

JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:

Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays

In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

a string
a number
an object
an array
a boolean
null
